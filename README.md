# MyMeals
## Description
MyMeals is an application that allows users to keep track of their food intake using spoonacular API.

### Inventory
Users can add food items to a fridge. Food items are verified through the spoonacular API database. Inside the fridge, food items are assigned storage percentages, which can be updated as users go through them. Once out of a food item, it is moved to the "Out of Stock" category. From there it can be deleted or added to the shopping cart for future purchase.
